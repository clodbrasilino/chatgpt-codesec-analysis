I'm sorry for the confusion, but C language does not support regex natively. You would need to use a library like PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) to use regex in C. However, you can achieve the task without regex. Here is a simple C program that replaces whitespaces with underscores and vice versa in a given string:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void replace_chars(char *str) {
    for(int i = 0; str[i]; i++){
        if(str[i] == ' ')
            str[i] = '_';
        else if(str[i] == '_')
            str[i] = ' ';
    }
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "Hello_World This_is_a_test";
    printf("Before: %s\n", str);
    replace_chars(str);
    printf("After: %s\n", str);
    return 0;
}
```

This program defines a function `replace_chars` that iterates over each character in the string. If the character is a space, it replaces it with an underscore. If the character is an underscore, it replaces it with a space. The `main` function demonstrates how to use this function with a test string.
