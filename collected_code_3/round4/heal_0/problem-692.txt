```C
#include <stdio.h>

int lastTwoDigitsOfFactorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1)
        return 1;
    if (n == 2)
        return 2;
    if (n == 3)
        return 6;
    if (n == 4)
        return 4;
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    int num;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);
    printf("Last two digits of factorial of %d is %02d\n", num, lastTwoDigitsOfFactorial(num));
    return 0;
}
```
This code will only work for numbers from 0 to 4. For numbers 5 and above, the last two digits of the factorial will always be 0. This is because the factorial of any number greater than 4 will always be a multiple of 10 (since it's a product of at least one each of 2 and 5), and hence end in 0.
