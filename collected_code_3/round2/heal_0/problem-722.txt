Here is a simple C program that filters students based on their height and width. Please note that in C, there is no built-in dictionary type. Instead, we can use a struct to represent a student with height and width attributes. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int height;
    int width;
} Student;

void filter_students(Student students[], int n, int min_height, int max_height, int min_width, int max_width) {
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(students[i].height >= min_height && students[i].height <= max_height && students[i].width >= min_width && students[i].width <= max_width) {
            printf("Student %d meets the criteria\n", i+1);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    Student students[] = {
        {170, 60},
        {180, 70},
        {160, 50},
        {175, 65}
    };

    int n = sizeof(students) / sizeof(Student);

    filter_students(students, n, 165, 180, 60, 70);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we define a `Student` struct with `height` and `width` attributes. We then create an array of `Student` structs to represent our students. 

The `filter_students` function takes this array, along with the number of students and the minimum and maximum acceptable heights and widths. It then loops through each student, checking if their height and width fall within the specified ranges. If they do, it prints a message saying that the student meets the criteria.

The `main` function creates an array of `Student` structs and calls `filter_students` with this array and some specified height and width ranges.
