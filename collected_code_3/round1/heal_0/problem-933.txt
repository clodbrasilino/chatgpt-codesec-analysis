Here is a simple C program that converts a camel case string to a snake case string. However, please note that C doesn't support regex natively. We would need to use a library like PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) to use regex in C. The following program doesn't use regex due to this limitation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>

void camel_to_snake(char *input, char *output) {
    while (*input) {
        if (isupper(*input)) {
            *output++ = '_';
            *output++ = tolower(*input);
        } else {
            *output++ = *input;
        }
        input++;
    }
    *output = '\0';
}

int main() {
    char input[100], output[100];
    printf("Enter a camelCase string: ");
    scanf("%s", input);
    camel_to_snake(input, output);
    printf("The snake_case string is: %s\n", output);
    return 0;
}
```

This program works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is an uppercase letter, it adds an underscore and the lowercase version of the letter to the output string. If the character is not an uppercase letter, it simply adds the character to the output string.
