C language does not support regex natively. You need to use external libraries like PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) to use regex in C. However, you can achieve the task of removing multiple spaces in a string without using regex. Here is a simple C program that does this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void removeMultipleSpaces(char* str) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; str[i]; i++)
        if (str[i] != ' ' || (str[i] == ' ' && str[i+1] != ' '))
            str[count++] = str[i];
    str[count] = '\0';
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "C   programming      language";
    removeMultipleSpaces(str);
    printf("%s", str);
    return 0;
}
```

This program works by iterating over the string and copying each character to the new string unless the character is a space and the next character is also a space. In that case, it skips the current character. After the loop, it adds a null character at the end of the new string to mark its end.
