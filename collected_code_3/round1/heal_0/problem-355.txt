The question seems to be a bit ambiguous as it's not clear what the dimensions of the rectangles are or how they are positioned within the circle. However, if we assume that the rectangles are squares of side length 1, and they are arranged in a grid pattern within the circle, we can write a function to count the number of squares that fit within the circle. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int count_rectangles_in_circle(int r) {
    int diameter = 2 * r;
    int side = sqrt(2) * r;
    return (side * side);
}

int main() {
    int r;
    printf("Enter the radius of the circle: ");
    scanf("%d", &r);
    int count = count_rectangles_in_circle(r);
    printf("Number of rectangles in the circle: %d\n", count);
    return 0;
}
```

This program first calculates the diameter of the circle, then calculates the side length of the largest square that can fit within the circle (which is the diameter divided by the square root of 2). It then calculates the number of 1x1 squares that can fit within this larger square (which is simply the area of the larger square), and returns this number. 

Please note that this is a simplified approach and does not account for additional rectangles that could potentially fit within the remaining circular area outside of the largest inscribed square.
