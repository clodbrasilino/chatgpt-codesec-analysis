This program calculates the median of a trapezium. The median (also known as the mid-segment or mid-line) of a trapezium is the line segment linking the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezium, i.e., m = 0.5 * (a + b). The height h is not relevant for calculating the median of a trapezium. However, the formula used in the function findMedian is the formula for the area of a trapezium, not its median.
