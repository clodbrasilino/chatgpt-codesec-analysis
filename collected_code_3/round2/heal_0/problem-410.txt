In C, it's not possible to create a truly heterogeneous list like in Python or JavaScript. C is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time. For this reason, you can't have a list (or an array, in C terms) that contains, for example, both integers and strings.

However, if you want to find the minimum value in an array of integers, you can do it like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int findMin(int arr[], int n) {
    int min = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] < min) {
            min = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return min;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 1, 2, 3};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    printf("Minimum value in the array is %d\n", findMin(arr, n));
    return 0;
}
```

This program will print `Minimum value in the array is 1`, which is the smallest number in the array.
