Examining collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-906.c

FINAL RESULTS:

collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-906.c:43:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-906.c:45:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-906.c:47:  [2] (buffer) memcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination (CWE-120).
  Make sure destination can always hold the source data.
collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-906.c:67:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-906.c:68:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-906.c:69:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-906.c:65:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
