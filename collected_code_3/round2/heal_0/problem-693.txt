Unfortunately, C does not natively support regular expressions (regex). However, you can achieve the same result using standard C libraries. Here's a simple C program that removes multiple spaces from a string:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void removeMultipleSpaces(char* str) {
    int count = 0, i;
    for (i = 0; str[i]; i++)
        if (str[i] != ' ' || (i > 0 && str[i-1] != ' '))
            str[count++] = str[i];
    str[count] = '\0';
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "C   Programming    Language";
    removeMultipleSpaces(str);
    printf("%s", str);
    return 0;
}
```

This program will output: "C Programming Language". It works by iterating over the string and copying each character to a new position in the string unless the character is a space and the previous character was also a space.
