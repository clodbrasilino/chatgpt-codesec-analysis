Here is a C program that calculates the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

long long newmanShanksWilliams(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    long long prevPrev = 1;
    long long prev = 1;
    long long current;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        current = 2 * prev + prevPrev;
        prevPrev = prev;
        prev = current;
    }
    return current;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("The %dth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number is %lld\n", n, newmanShanksWilliams(n));
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that the Newman-Shanks-Williams numbers are not prime numbers. The term "Newman-Shanks-Williams prime" is not a recognized term in number theory. The Newman-Shanks-Williams numbers are a sequence of numbers related to the geometry of the projective plane. The code above calculates the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams number, not a prime number.
