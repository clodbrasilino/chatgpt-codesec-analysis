In C, there is no built-in data type for tuples as in Python or other high-level languages. However, we can use a struct to represent a tuple. Here is an example of how you can find the size of a tuple in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int a;
    double b;
    char c;
} Tuple;

int getTupleSize(Tuple tuple) {
    return sizeof(tuple);
}

int main() {
    Tuple tuple = {1, 2.0, 'a'};
    printf("Size of tuple: %d bytes\n", getTupleSize(tuple));
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, a tuple is represented as a struct with three fields: an integer, a double, and a character. The `getTupleSize` function returns the size of the tuple in bytes. The `main` function creates a tuple and prints its size.
