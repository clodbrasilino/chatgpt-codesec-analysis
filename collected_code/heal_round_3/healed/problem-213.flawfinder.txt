Examining collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-213.c

FINAL RESULTS:

collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-213.c:28:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.

  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-213.c:16:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:
  Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for invalid
  pointers [MS-banned] (CWE-120).
collected_code/heal_round_3/healed/problem-213.c:23:  [1] (buffer) strncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum
  size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, snprintf,
  or automatically resizing strings.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
