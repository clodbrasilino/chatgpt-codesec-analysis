Number of rules (primarily dangerous function names) in C/C++ ruleset: 222
Examining collected_code/problem-9-0.c

FINAL RESULTS:

collected_code/problem-9-0.c:7:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
collected_code/problem-9-0.c:8:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination
  [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or
  snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused).
collected_code/problem-9-0.c:5:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
