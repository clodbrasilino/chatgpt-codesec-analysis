Examining collected_code/healed/problem-192.c

FINAL RESULTS:

collected_code/healed/problem-192.c:22:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
collected_code/healed/problem-192.c:24:  [1] (buffer) scanf:
  It's unclear if the %s limit in the format string is small enough
  (CWE-120). Check that the limit is sufficiently small, or use a different
  input function.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
