The weaknesses in this code were mainly related to missing null checks after dynamic memory allocation, which have been added in my adjustments. This can help guard against an Out of Memory (OOM) condition. Even though modern system often do not return a NULL pointer, reflecting bad practice in code would not be proper. Always check for NULL when you allocate memory dynamically. Additionally, there was a concern regarding uninitialized values, but considering every element of the matrix was assigned a value before they were used in the printf statement, the concern should be unfounded.
