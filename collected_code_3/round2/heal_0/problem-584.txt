Here is a C program that uses the PCRE library to find all adverbs in a given sentence. Please note that this program is a basic implementation and may not cover all possible adverbs in English language. It assumes that adverbs end with 'ly'.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <pcre.h>

#define MAX_MATCHES 30

void find_adverbs(char *str) {
    pcre *re;
    const char *error;
    int erroffset;
    int ovector[MAX_MATCHES];
    int rc, i;

    re = pcre_compile("\\b\\w+ly\\b", 0, &error, &erroffset, NULL);
    if (re == NULL) {
        printf("PCRE compilation failed at offset %d: %s\n", erroffset, error);
        return;
    }

    rc = pcre_exec(re, NULL, str, strlen(str), 0, 0, ovector, MAX_MATCHES);
    if (rc < 0) {
        printf("Match failed\n");
        return;
    }

    for(i = 0; i < rc; i++) {
        printf("Matched adverb: %.*s at position %d\n", ovector[2*i+1] - ovector[2*i], str + ovector[2*i], ovector[2*i]);
    }

    pcre_free(re);
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "He quickly ran towards the slowly moving train.";
    find_adverbs(str);
    return 0;
}
```

This program uses the PCRE library to compile and execute a regular expression that matches words ending with 'ly'. The `pcre_exec` function returns the number of matches and fills the `ovector` array with the positions of the matches. The matched adverbs and their positions are then printed.

Please note that you need to have the PCRE library installed to compile and run this program. You can install it on Ubuntu with `sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev` and on CentOS with `sudo yum install pcre-devel`. To compile the program, you can use `gcc -o find_adverbs find_adverbs.c -lpcre`.

Also, this is a very basic implementation and may not cover all possible adverbs in English language. It assumes that adverbs end with 'ly', which is not always the case.
