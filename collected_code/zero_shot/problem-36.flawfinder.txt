Number of rules (primarily dangerous function names) in C/C++ ruleset: 222
Examining collected_code/problem-36-0.c

FINAL RESULTS:

collected_code/problem-36-0.c:16:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
collected_code/problem-36-0.c:17:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows (CWE-120). Use sprintf_s, snprintf, or
  vsnprintf. Risk is low because the source has a constant maximum length.

ANALYSIS SUMMARY:

Hits = 2
Lines analyzed = 40 in approximately 0.14 seconds (285 lines/second)
Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC) = 28
Hits@level = [0]   8 [1]   0 [2]   2 [3]   0 [4]   0 [5]   0
Hits@level+ = [0+]  10 [1+]   2 [2+]   2 [3+]   0 [4+]   0 [5+]   0

Minimum risk level = 1

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
