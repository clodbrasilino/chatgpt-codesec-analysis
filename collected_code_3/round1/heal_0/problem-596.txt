In C, there is no native support for tuples like in Python or other high-level languages. The closest thing to a tuple in C would be a struct or an array. Here is an example of how you might find the size of a struct, which is similar to a tuple.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Tuple {
    int a;
    float b;
    double c;
    char d;
};

int findSize(struct Tuple tuple) {
    return sizeof(tuple);
}

int main() {
    struct Tuple tuple = {1, 2.0f, 3.0, 'a'};
    printf("Size of tuple: %d bytes\n", findSize(tuple));
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `findSize` function takes a `Tuple` struct as an argument and returns the size of the struct in bytes. The `main` function creates a `Tuple` struct, calls `findSize` with the struct as an argument, and prints the size of the struct.
