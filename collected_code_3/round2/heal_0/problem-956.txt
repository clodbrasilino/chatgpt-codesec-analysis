Unfortunately, C does not have built-in support for regular expressions. You would need to use a library like POSIX regex or PCRE to use regular expressions in C. However, you can accomplish the task without regex by using ASCII values to identify uppercase letters. Here is a simple C program that does this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

void splitString(char *str) {
    int len = strlen(str);
    for(int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if(isupper(str[i])) {
            printf("\n");
        }
        printf("%c", str[i]);
    }
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "HelloWorldThisIsATest";
    splitString(str);
    return 0;
}
```

This program will print each segment of the string that is separated by an uppercase letter on a new line. It uses the `isupper` function from the `ctype.h` library to check if a character is uppercase. If it is, it prints a newline character before printing the character.
