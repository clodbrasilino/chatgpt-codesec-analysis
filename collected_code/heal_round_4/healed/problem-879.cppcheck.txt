Now, dynamically allocated memory is used to handle strings. This prevents the possibility of overflow by statically-sized arrays. The input string is checked if it is NULL. regfree and free are called to release memory before we return from the function. This prevents memory leaks. Regerror usage has an appropriately sized buffer.
