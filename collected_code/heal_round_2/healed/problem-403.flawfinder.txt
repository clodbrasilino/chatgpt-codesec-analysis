Examining collected_code/heal_round_2/healed/problem-403.c

FINAL RESULTS:

collected_code/heal_round_2/healed/problem-403.c:8:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.

collected_code/heal_round_2/healed/problem-403.c:37:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
