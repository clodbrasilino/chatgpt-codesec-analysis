Here is a simple C program that finds common elements in two given arrays. Note that C does not support nested lists like Python or other high-level languages. Therefore, the concept of nested lists has been simplified to 2D arrays.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define ROW 3
#define COL 3

void findCommon(int arr1[ROW][COL], int arr2[ROW][COL]) {
    int i, j, k, l;

    for (i = 0; i < ROW; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < COL; j++) {
            for (k = 0; k < ROW; k++) {
                for (l = 0; l < COL; l++) {
                    if (arr1[i][j] == arr2[k][l]) {
                        printf("%d ", arr1[i][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr1[ROW][COL] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    int arr2[ROW][COL] = {{7, 2, 10}, {4, 11, 12}, {13, 14, 15}};

    printf("Common elements are: ");
    findCommon(arr1, arr2);

    return 0;
}
```

This program will print the common elements in the two given 2D arrays. Note that this program assumes that the two arrays have the same dimensions. If the arrays have different dimensions, you would need to modify the function to handle that.
