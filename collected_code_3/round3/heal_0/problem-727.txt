```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

void remove_special_characters(char* str) {
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    while (str[i]) {
        if (isalnum(str[i])) {
            str[j++] = str[i];
        }
        i++;
    }
    str[j] = '\0';
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "a1b2c3!@#";
    remove_special_characters(str);
    printf("%s\n", str);
    return 0;
}
```
Please note that C does not support regex natively. You would need to use a library such as PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) to use regex in C. The above code does not use regex, but it achieves the same result by checking if each character is alphanumeric (a letter or a number) using the `isalnum` function. If a character is not alphanumeric, it is removed from the string.
