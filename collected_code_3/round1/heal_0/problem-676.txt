In C, there is no built-in support for regular expressions (regex). However, you can use the functions provided by the C Standard Library to achieve the same result. Here is a simple C program that removes everything except alphanumeric characters from a given string:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>

void remove_non_alphanumeric(char *str) {
    int i, j = 0, len;
    len = strlen(str);
    for(i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if(isalnum(str[i])) {
            str[j++] = str[i];
        }
    }
    str[j] = '\0';
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "Hello, World! 123";
    remove_non_alphanumeric(str);
    printf("%s\n", str);
    return 0;
}
```

In this program, the `remove_non_alphanumeric` function iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is alphanumeric (checked using the `isalnum` function), it is copied to the new position in the string. All non-alphanumeric characters are effectively skipped, and the string is terminated with a null character. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of this function with a sample string.
