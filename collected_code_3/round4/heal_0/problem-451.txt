Unfortunately, the C programming language does not natively support regular expressions (regex). However, you can achieve the same result using a different approach. Here is a simple C program that removes all whitespaces from a given string:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

void remove_spaces(char* str) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; str[i]; i++) {
        if (!isspace(str[i])) {
            str[count++] = str[i];
        }
    }
    str[count] = '\0';
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "Hello, World! This is a test string.";
    remove_spaces(str);
    printf("%s\n", str);
    return 0;
}
```

This program defines a function `remove_spaces` that iterates over the characters in the input string. If a character is not a whitespace character (as determined by the `isspace` function), it is copied to the current position in the string. The position is then incremented. If the character is a whitespace character, it is simply skipped. When all characters have been processed, a null character is appended to the string to mark its end.

The `main` function tests this function with a sample string. After the call to `remove_spaces`, the string no longer contains any whitespace characters.
