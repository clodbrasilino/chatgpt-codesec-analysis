The question seems to be a bit unclear as it's not possible to count the number of rectangles in a circle of radius r in a traditional sense. However, if we are considering a grid inside a circle and trying to count the rectangles in that grid which are completely inside the circle, we could write a program for that. Here is a simple C program that counts the number of rectangles in a grid that fits inside a circle of radius r:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int countRectanglesInCircle(int r) {
    int count = 0;
    int x, y;
    for (x = 1; x <= r; x++) {
        for (y = 1; y <= r; y++) {
            if (x * x + y * y <= r * r) {
                count += x * y;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int r;
    printf("Enter the radius of the circle: ");
    scanf("%d", &r);
    int rectangles = countRectanglesInCircle(r);
    printf("Number of rectangles in a circle of radius %d is: %d\n", r, rectangles);
    return 0;
}
```

This program counts the number of rectangles that can be formed in a grid that fits inside a circle of radius r. It does this by iterating over all possible pairs of points (x, y) in the grid and checking if the point is inside the circle (i.e., x^2 + y^2 <= r^2). If the point is inside the circle, it adds the number of rectangles that can be formed with this point as one of the corners (i.e., x * y) to the total count.
