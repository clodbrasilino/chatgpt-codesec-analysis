C language does not have a built-in map function like Python or JavaScript. However, we can achieve similar functionality by creating a function that iterates over an array of strings and performs an operation on each string. Here is an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void printString(char* str) {
    printf("%s\n", str);
}

void map(char** arr, int size, void (*func)(char*)) {
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        func(arr[i]);
    }
}

int main() {
    char* strings[] = {"Hello", "World", "This", "Is", "C"};
    int size = sizeof(strings) / sizeof(strings[0]);

    map(strings, size, printString);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, `map` is a function that takes an array of strings, the size of the array, and a function pointer. It applies the function to each string in the array. The `printString` function is used to print each string. In the `main` function, we create an array of strings and pass it to the `map` function along with the `printString` function.
