# Proof-Of-Concept examples

These manual examples were ran following the source on [the video "the TRUTH about ChatGPT generated code", from Low Level Learning Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvtfPva1a04), as a starting point for this research.

[The prompts](prompts.py) are the same as used in the video. You can change the [collect code script](../collect_code.py) to run over those prompts, and do the checkings.
