The question seems to be a bit confusing as tuples and lists are not native data structures in C. C is a low-level language and does not support high-level data structures like tuples and lists as in Python or other high-level languages. However, you can create similar structures using arrays, structures, and linked lists, but there's no straightforward way to count lists in a tuple as you would in Python.

If you're looking for a C equivalent to count lists in a tuple, you'd need to define what you mean by a "tuple" and a "list" in the context of C. 

Here's an example of how you might implement a linked list in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
} Node;

Node* createNode(int data) {
    Node* newNode = (Node*)malloc(sizeof(Node));
    if(newNode == NULL) {
        printf("Error creating a new node.\n");
        exit(0);
    }
    newNode->data = data;
    newNode->next = NULL;

    return newNode;
}

int countNodes(Node* head) {
    Node* current = head;
    int count = 0;

    while(current != NULL) {
        count++;
        current = current->next;
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    Node* head = createNode(1);
    head->next = createNode(2);
    head->next->next = createNode(3);

    printf("Number of nodes: %d\n", countNodes(head));

    return 0;
}
```

This program creates a linked list with three nodes and then counts the number of nodes in the list. But remember, this is a very basic example and real-world programs would need to handle freeing memory and other concerns.
