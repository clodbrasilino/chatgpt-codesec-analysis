The question seems to be a bit unclear as tuples and colons don't have a direct relationship in C programming. However, if you are looking for a way to create a tuple-like structure in C and then access its elements, you can use a struct. Here is an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define a tuple-like structure
struct Tuple {
    int a;
    int b;
};

// Function to get a colon of a tuple
struct Tuple getColon(int a, int b) {
    struct Tuple t;
    t.a = a;
    t.b = b;
    return t;
}

int main() {
    // Create a tuple
    struct Tuple t = getColon(5, 10);

    // Print the elements of the tuple
    printf("Tuple: (%d, %d)\n", t.a, t.b);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, a struct is used to create a tuple-like structure. The `getColon` function initializes a `Tuple` struct with two integers and returns it. The `main` function then creates a `Tuple` using `getColon` and prints its elements.
