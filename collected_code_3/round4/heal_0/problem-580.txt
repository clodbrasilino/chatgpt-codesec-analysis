Here is a C program that extracts the even elements from a 2D array (which is equivalent to a nested tuple in Python). Note that C doesn't have a built-in tuple data type, so we'll use a 2D array for this example.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define ROW 3
#define COL 3

void extractEven(int arr[ROW][COL], int row, int col) {
    int i, j;
    for(i = 0; i < row; i++) {
        for(j = 0; j < col; j++) {
            if(arr[i][j] % 2 == 0) {
                printf("%d ", arr[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[ROW][COL] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    extractEven(arr, ROW, COL);
    return 0;
}
```

In this program, the `extractEven` function iterates over each element in the 2D array. If the element is even (i.e., if it's divisible by 2), it's printed to the console. The `main` function defines a 2D array and calls `extractEven` on it.
