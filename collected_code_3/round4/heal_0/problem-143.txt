The question seems to be a bit confused as it's mixing terminologies from different programming languages. In C, there are no built-in data types such as lists or tuples as in Python. C is a statically typed language where you need to explicitly define all variables and their types. 

However, I can show you how to count the number of arrays (which are somewhat equivalent to lists in Python) in a struct (which can be considered as a rough equivalent to a tuple in Python). 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct Tuple {
    int arr1[10];
    int arr2[10];
    int arr3[10];
};

int count_arrays_in_tuple() {
    return sizeof(struct Tuple) / sizeof(int[10]);
}

int main() {
    printf("Number of arrays in tuple: %d\n", count_arrays_in_tuple());
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we define a struct `Tuple` that contains three arrays. The function `count_arrays_in_tuple` returns the number of arrays in the struct by dividing the total size of the struct by the size of one array. The `main` function then prints out this number.
