            if(arr1[i] == arr2[j]) {
                printf("%d ", arr1[i]);
                break;

int main() {
    int arr1[N] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

In this code, we have defined a function named `find_similar` that takes two integer arrays and their size as input. It then compares each element from the first array with each element from the second array. If a match is found, it prints the matching element and breaks the inner loop to move to the next element in the first array. The `main` function initializes two arrays and calls the `find_similar` function with these arrays. The program prints the common elements between the two arrays.
