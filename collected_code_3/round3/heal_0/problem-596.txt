In C, there is no built-in support for tuples like in Python or other high-level languages. However, we can mimic a tuple using a struct. Here is a simple example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int a;
    float b;
    char c;
} Tuple;

int getTupleSize(Tuple tuple) {
    return sizeof(tuple);
}

int main() {
    Tuple tuple = {1, 2.0, 'c'};
    printf("Size of tuple: %d bytes\n", getTupleSize(tuple));
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a `Tuple` struct that contains an integer, a float, and a character. The `getTupleSize` function returns the size of the `Tuple` in bytes. The `main` function creates a `Tuple`, prints its size, and returns 0.
