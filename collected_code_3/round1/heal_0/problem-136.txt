This program calculates the electricity bill according to the following conditions:

- For the first 50 units, the cost is $0.50/unit.
- For the next 100 units (i.e., from 51 to 150), the cost is $0.75/unit.
- For the next 100 units (i.e., from 151 to 250), the cost is $1.20/unit.
- Beyond 250 units, the cost is $1.50/unit.
- Additionally, a 20% surcharge is added to the bill.
