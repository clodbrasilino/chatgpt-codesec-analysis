In the updated version, we first calculate the length of the tuple and list strings outside of the loop. This is done to prevent the lengths of these strings from being continuously re-calculated each iteration. We also ensure to check `(i < tuple_length) && (i < size_list - 1)` in the loop condition so that the loop terminates when we reach the end of tuple string or if we exceed the size of list by 1. The `-1` is to reserve a space for the terminating zero. This updated version also deals with the issue where a string passed to the function is not null-terminated. It only allows strings that are null-terminated.
