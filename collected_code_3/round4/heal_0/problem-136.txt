```C
#include <stdio.h>

float calculateBill(float units) {
    float bill;
    if (units <= 50) {
        bill = units * 0.50;
    } else if (units <= 150) {
        bill = 25 + ((units-50) * 0.75);
    } else if (units <= 250) {
        bill = 100 + ((units-150) * 1.20);
    } else {
        bill = 220 + ((units-250) * 1.50);
    }
    bill = bill + (bill * 0.20);
    return bill;
}

int main() {
    float units;
    printf("Enter total units consumed: ");
    scanf("%f", &units);
    printf("Electricity bill = $%.2f", calculateBill(units));
    return 0;
}
```

This program calculates the electricity bill according to the following rates:

- For the first 50 units: $0.50/unit
- For the next 100 units: $0.75/unit
- For the next 100 units: $1.20/unit
- For usage above 250 units: $1.50/unit

An additional 20% is added to the bill as a surcharge. The `calculateBill` function calculates the bill according to these rates. The `main` function gets the number of units from the user and prints the calculated bill.
