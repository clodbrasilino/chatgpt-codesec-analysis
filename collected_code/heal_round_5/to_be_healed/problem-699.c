This revised version of the code applies bug fixes and enhancements pointed out in the initial code comments. It also adds an improved string validation method. 

/* Possible weaknesses found:
 *   Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops  (CWE-120, CWE-20).
 *   Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
 */
This version uses strnlen instead of strlen avoiding potential over-read in case of non-null terminated strings. 

/* Possible weaknesses found:
 *  No pair for character ('). Can't process file. File is either invalid or unicode, which is currently not supported. [syntaxError]
 *  missing terminating ' character
 */
It also used bitwise operations instead of division and modulo operations to potentially improve performance. It's worth mentioning though, that any decent C compiler will automatically optimize division and modulo operations with powers of 2 into bitwise operations where possible.
