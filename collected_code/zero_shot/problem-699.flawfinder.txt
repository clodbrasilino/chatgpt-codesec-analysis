Number of rules (primarily dangerous function names) in C/C++ ruleset: 222
Examining collected_code/problem-699-0.c

FINAL RESULTS:

collected_code/problem-699-0.c:5:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
collected_code/problem-699-0.c:6:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).
collected_code/problem-699-0.c:26:  [1] (buffer) mismatch:
  Function does not check the second iterator for over-read conditions
  (CWE-126). This function is often discouraged by most C++ coding standards
  in favor of its safer alternatives provided since C++14. Consider using a
  form of this function that checks the second iterator before potentially
  overflowing it.
collected_code/problem-699-0.c:30:  [1] (buffer) mismatch:
  Function does not check the second iterator for over-read conditions
  (CWE-126). This function is often discouraged by most C++ coding standards
  in favor of its safer alternatives provided since C++14. Consider using a
  form of this function that checks the second iterator before potentially
  overflowing it.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
