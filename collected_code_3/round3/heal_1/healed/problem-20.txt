It seems no actual code has been provided to revise or rewrite. However, based on the comments regarding a possible function checking the condition of a "woodball" number, I can provide a basic structure of the generic C Program where you could add the specific logic for it. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// placeholder for woodball_check function. 
// Replace content with the actual 'woodball' number checking algorithm whenever that is defined
int isWoodball(int num) {
    // Add specific 'woodball' number checking logic here
    return 0;
}

int main()
{
    int num;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    if(isWoodball(num)) {
        printf("%d is a woodball number.\n", num);
    } else {
        printf("%d is not a woodball number.\n", num);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Please replace `isWoodball` function logic with actual 'woodball' number checking logic when you have it. As of now it always returns 0, meaning no number is a 'woodball' number.
