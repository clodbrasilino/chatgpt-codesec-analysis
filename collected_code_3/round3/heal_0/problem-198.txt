This program assumes that the largest triangle that can be inscribed in an ellipse is a right triangle with its hypotenuse along the major axis of the ellipse and its other two sides along the minor axis. The semi-major axis length is taken as the base of the triangle and the semi-minor axis length is taken as the height. The area of the triangle is then calculated using the formula 1/2 * base * height.
