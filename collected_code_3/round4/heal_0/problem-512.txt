Here is a simple C program that counts the frequency of elements in a mixed nested array. Please note that C does not support tuples like Python or other high-level languages. So, I am using an array for this purpose.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 1000

void count_frequency(int arr[], int n) {
    int freq[MAX_SIZE] = {0};
    int i;

    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        freq[arr[i]]++;
    }

    for(i = 0; i < MAX_SIZE; i++) {
        if(freq[i] != 0) {
            printf("%d occurs %d times\n", i, freq[i]);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);

    count_frequency(arr, n);

    return 0;
}
```

This program will count the frequency of each element in the array and print it. Please note that this program assumes that the elements of the array are non-negative and less than `MAX_SIZE`. If the elements can be negative or greater than `MAX_SIZE`, you should use a different data structure (like a hash table) to count the frequencies.
