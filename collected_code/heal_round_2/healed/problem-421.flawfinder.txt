Examining collected_code/heal_round_2/healed/problem-421.c

FINAL RESULTS:

collected_code/heal_round_2/healed/problem-421.c:7:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
collected_code/heal_round_2/healed/problem-421.c:18:  [1] (buffer) strncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum
  size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, snprintf,
  or automatically resizing strings.
collected_code/heal_round_2/healed/problem-421.c:29:  [1] (buffer) strncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct maximum
  size to add) [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider strcat_s, strlcat, snprintf,
  or automatically resizing strings.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
