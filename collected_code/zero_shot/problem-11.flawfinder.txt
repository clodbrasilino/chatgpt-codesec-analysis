Number of rules (primarily dangerous function names) in C/C++ ruleset: 222
Examining collected_code/problem-11-0.c

FINAL RESULTS:

collected_code/problem-11-0.c:48:  [4] (buffer) scanf:
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Specify a limit to %s, or use a
  different input function.
collected_code/problem-11-0.c:43:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.
collected_code/problem-11-0.c:5:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.
