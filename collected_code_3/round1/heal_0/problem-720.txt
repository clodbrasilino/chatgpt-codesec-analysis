In C, there is no built-in support for data structures like dictionaries or tuples. However, we can use structures and arrays to create similar functionality. Here is a simple example of how you might create a dictionary-like structure and add it to an array (which is somewhat similar to a tuple).

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_SIZE 100

typedef struct {
    char key[MAX_SIZE];
    char value[MAX_SIZE];
} Dictionary;

typedef struct {
    Dictionary dictionaries[MAX_SIZE];
    int size;
} Tuple;

void addDictionaryToTuple(Tuple *tuple, Dictionary dictionary) {
    tuple->dictionaries[tuple->size] = dictionary;
    tuple->size++;
}

int main() {
    Tuple tuple;
    tuple.size = 0;

    Dictionary dictionary;
    strcpy(dictionary.key, "key1");
    strcpy(dictionary.value, "value1");

    addDictionaryToTuple(&tuple, dictionary);

    printf("Key: %s, Value: %s\n", tuple.dictionaries[0].key, tuple.dictionaries[0].value);

    return 0;
}
```

This code creates a `Dictionary` structure with `key` and `value` fields, and a `Tuple` structure that contains an array of `Dictionary` structures. The `addDictionaryToTuple` function adds a `Dictionary` to the `Tuple`.

Please note that this is a very basic and simplified implementation. In a real-world application, you would need to add error checking, handle memory allocation and deallocation, and possibly use more advanced data structures.
