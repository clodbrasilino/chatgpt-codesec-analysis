The task you've asked for is a bit ambiguous because it's not clear how the rectangles are defined, their size, or their orientation. However, I can provide a simple example of how you might count the number of rectangles that fit into a circle if you define a rectangle by its width and height. 

In this example, we'll count the number of rectangles that can fit into a circle without any part of the rectangle extending beyond the circle's circumference. We'll assume that the rectangle's width and height are integers, and that the circle's radius is also an integer.

Here's a simple C program that does this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int count_rectangles_in_circle(int r, int width, int height) {
    int diameter = 2 * r;
    int max_width = diameter / width;
    int max_height = diameter / height;
    return max_width * max_height;
}

int main() {
    int r = 10;
    int width = 2;
    int height = 3;
    int count = count_rectangles_in_circle(r, width, height);
    printf("Number of rectangles in a circle of radius %d: %d\n", r, count);
    return 0;
}
```

This program first calculates the diameter of the circle, which is twice the radius. It then calculates how many times the width and height of the rectangle can fit into the diameter. The product of these two values is the number of rectangles that can fit into the circle.

Please note that this is a very simple example and may not cover all possible cases. For example, it doesn't take into account the possibility of rotating the rectangles, and it assumes that the rectangles are evenly distributed across the circle.
