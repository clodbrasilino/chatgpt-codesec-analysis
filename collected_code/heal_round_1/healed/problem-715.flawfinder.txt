Examining collected_code/healed/problem-715.c

FINAL RESULTS:

collected_code/healed/problem-715.c:20:  [1] (buffer) strncpy:

  pointers [MS-banned] (CWE-120).
collected_code/healed/problem-715.c:22:  [1] (buffer) strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
