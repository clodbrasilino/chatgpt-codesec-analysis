Number of rules (primarily dangerous function names) in C/C++ ruleset: 222
Examining collected_code/problem-213-0.c

FINAL RESULTS:

collected_code/problem-213-0.c:4:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
collected_code/problem-213-0.c:5:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination
  [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or
  snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused).

ANALYSIS SUMMARY:

Hits = 2
Lines analyzed = 5 in approximately 0.40 seconds (12 lines/second)
Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC) = 5
Hits@level = [0]   0 [1]   0 [2]   0 [3]   0 [4]   2 [5]   0
Hits@level+ = [0+]   2 [1+]   2 [2+]   2 [3+]   2 [4+]   2 [5+]   0

Minimum risk level = 1

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
