In C, there is no built-in support for tuples like in Python or other high-level languages. However, we can use structures to represent a tuple. Here is a simple implementation of concatenating two tuples to a nested tuple.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int a;
    int b;
} Tuple;

typedef struct {
    Tuple t1;
    Tuple t2;
} NestedTuple;

NestedTuple concatenate(Tuple t1, Tuple t2) {
    NestedTuple nt;
    nt.t1 = t1;
    nt.t2 = t2;
    return nt;
}

int main() {
    Tuple t1 = {1, 2};
    Tuple t2 = {3, 4};
    NestedTuple nt = concatenate(t1, t2);
    printf("Nested Tuple: ((%d, %d), (%d, %d))\n", nt.t1.a, nt.t1.b, nt.t2.a, nt.t2.b);
    return 0;
}
```

This program defines a `Tuple` structure with two integer members, and a `NestedTuple` structure with two `Tuple` members. The `concatenate` function takes two `Tuple` instances and returns a `NestedTuple` containing those instances. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of these structures and the `concatenate` function.
