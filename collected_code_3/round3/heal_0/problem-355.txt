Your question seems to be a bit confusing as it's not clear how rectangles are placed inside the circle. If you're referring to a grid of rectangles and you want to count how many of them are fully inside the circle, you would need to know more parameters, like the dimensions of the rectangles. 

However, if you're referring to a mathematical problem where you're trying to find the number of lattice rectangles (i.e., rectangles whose vertices are all integer points) that can fit inside a circle of radius r, then it's a bit more complex and would involve some mathematical calculations. 

Here's a simple C program that counts the number of integer points in a circle, which is a step towards solving the above problem:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int countPointsInCircle(int r) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int x = -r; x <= r; x++) {
        for (int y = -r; y <= r; y++) {
            if (x*x + y*y <= r*r) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int r;
    printf("Enter the radius of the circle: ");
    scanf("%d", &r);
    int count = countPointsInCircle(r);
    printf("The number of integer points in the circle is: %d\n", count);
    return 0;
}
```

This program counts the number of integer points (x, y) that satisfy the equation of a circle x^2 + y^2 <= r^2. This is a necessary step to count the number of lattice rectangles in a circle, but the full solution would be more complex and would involve combinatorics.
