It seems like there might be some confusion in your request. In C programming, there is no built-in support for tuples like in Python or other high-level languages. However, we can use a struct to simulate a tuple. If by "get a colon of a tuple" you mean accessing a specific element of a tuple, here is an example of how you could do it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int first;
    int second;
} Tuple;

int getFirst(Tuple tuple) {
    return tuple.first;
}

int main() {
    Tuple tuple;
    tuple.first = 1;
    tuple.second = 2;

    printf("First element of the tuple: %d\n", getFirst(tuple));

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we define a `Tuple` struct that holds two integers. The `getFirst` function takes a `Tuple` and returns the first element. The `main` function creates a `Tuple`, assigns values to its elements, and then prints the first element by calling `getFirst`.
