The updated code addresses weaknesses by using the `strncpy` function in `mergeDictionaries` to copy at most `SIZE-1` characters from each array of the dictionaries to the result array, ensuring that array copying does not exceed the buffer size. The '\0' termination character is still explicitly assigned to prevent buffer overflows and excess reading. The `main` function remains unchanged as the original static size checking was sufficient.
