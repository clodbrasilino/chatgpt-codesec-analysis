The term "woodball" doesn't have a standard meaning in computer science or mathematics. It might be a term specific to a certain application, project, or company. Without knowing the specific rules that define what makes a number a "woodball" number, it's impossible to write a function that checks for it. 

/* Possible weaknesses found:
 *  missing terminating ' character
 */
Please provide the specific criteria or rules that define a "woodball" number, and I'd be happy to help write a function that checks for it.
