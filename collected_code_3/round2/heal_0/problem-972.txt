C programming language does not support tuples as a built-in data type like Python. However, we can use structures to mimic the behavior of tuples. Here is a code snippet that concatenates two structures into a nested structure.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct {
    int a;
    char b[50];
} Tuple;

typedef struct {
    Tuple t1;
    Tuple t2;
} NestedTuple;

NestedTuple concatenate(Tuple t1, Tuple t2) {
    NestedTuple nt;
    nt.t1 = t1;
    nt.t2 = t2;
    return nt;
}

int main() {
    Tuple t1 = {1, "Hello"};
    Tuple t2 = {2, "World"};
    NestedTuple nt = concatenate(t1, t2);
    printf("Nested Tuple: ((%d, %s), (%d, %s))\n", nt.t1.a, nt.t1.b, nt.t2.a, nt.t2.b);
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines two structures, `Tuple` and `NestedTuple`. `Tuple` is used to represent a tuple with an integer and a string, and `NestedTuple` is used to represent a nested tuple that contains two `Tuple` structures. The `concatenate` function takes two `Tuple` structures as input and returns a `NestedTuple` structure that contains the two input structures. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `concatenate` function to concatenate two `Tuple` structures into a `NestedTuple` structure.
