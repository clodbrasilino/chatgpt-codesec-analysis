Here is a simple C program that subtracts the elements of two arrays (since C does not have built-in support for tuples). This program assumes that the two arrays have the same length.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define SIZE 5

void subtract_arrays(int a[], int b[], int c[], int size) {
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        c[i] = a[i] - b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int a[SIZE] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int b[SIZE] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int c[SIZE];

    subtract_arrays(a, b, c, SIZE);

    printf("Result: ");
    for(int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
        printf("%d ", c[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this program, the `subtract_arrays` function takes as input three arrays and their size. It subtracts the elements of the second array from the corresponding elements of the first array, and stores the results in the third array. The `main` function initializes two arrays `a` and `b`, calls `subtract_arrays` to subtract their elements, and then prints the resulting array `c`.
